        description: "This initial phase focuses on understanding the specific legal and cultural landscape of the Myanmar market. Designers and analysts meet with stakeholders to identify the must-have features, such as Social Security Board (SSB) reporting formats, personal income tax laws, and common local holiday structures. This step ensures the software isn't just a generic HR tool, but a solution tailored to local compliance."

        title: "Information Architecture (IA)",
        description: "This involves organizing the massive amount of HR data into a logical structure. The design team decides how to categorize modules (e.g., separating Core HR from Asset Management) so that the navigation is intuitive. The goal is to ensure that any user can find a specific function, such as Roster Planning or Tax History, within two to three clicks."

        title: "Wireframing",
        description: "Before adding colors or logos, the team creates skeletal layouts of the screens. This phase focuses on the layout of data tables and form fields. In an HRMS, wireframing is crucial for ensuring that complex tables (like attendance logs) remain readable on different screen sizes and that Action Buttons (Approve/Reject) are clearly visible."

        title: "Visual UI Design",
        description: "Here, the visual identity is applied. For Bamawl HR, this means using a clean, professional color palette that minimizes eye strain for HR officers who look at the screen for hours. It includes designing custom icons for different HR modules and ensuring that the mobile app interface is thumb-friendly for quick check-ins and check-outs."

        description: "The system undergoes rigorous User Acceptance Testing (UAT). Real HR managers test the workflows to see if the Payroll Logic matches their manual calculations. Based on this feedback, the design is iterated or tweaked—for example, making a button larger or adding a filter to a report—to improve the overall user experience."
