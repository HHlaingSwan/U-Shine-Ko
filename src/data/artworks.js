      projectOverview: 'A modern, responsive portfolio website showcasing various design projects. Built with React and Tailwind CSS for a seamless user experience across all devices. The primary goal was to create a clean, minimalist design that puts the focus on the visual work, while ensuring high performance and accessibility.',

      uxProcess: 'The project followed a Lean UX approach, starting with user research and competitive analysis to identify key features and design patterns. Wireframes and low-fidelity prototypes were created and iterated upon based on early feedback. High-fidelity mockups were then developed, focusing on visual hierarchy, typography, and color theory to align with the personal brand. Usability testing was conducted throughout the development cycle to ensure an intuitive and delightful user experience.',
      challenge: 'The primary challenge was to create a design that is both visually engaging and extremely fast to load, avoiding the common pitfall of portfolio sites that are slow due to large media assets. It also needed to be easily maintainable.',
      solution: 'Implemented lazy loading for images and code splitting for routes. Used a static site generation approach for the final build to ensure a highly performant and SEO-friendly result. The design focused on strong typography and a clear grid system to showcase work effectively without relying on heavy graphical elements.',
